# Arduino-Light-Sensor-Instrument
This is my final project for a five-week Arduino class.  
It maps the analog input value from a light sensor to a value within a range of a few octaves and then plays that tone on a piezo speaker.  
In addition, I added a button that turns the instrument on and off and a set of four LEDs that toggle based on the pitch of the tone.  
I used an Arduino Uno 101 with an EducationShield to make this.  
Here's what the design looks like: https://imgur.com/a/8AZ7zh4
